# Data Structures
This repository is for tracking my learning journey in Data Structures using the C language and the algorithms used to work with them
## Linked list
First I will start implementing linked lists. A linkd list is an abstract data structure based on nodes wich contain data and reference. There are 3 main types of linked lists (with its variants), so we are going to implement them all. And also build the algorithms that are used to work with these. 
### Single linked list
Each node in this type of list contains two values, the data that its meant to store and the reference of the next node. For this example I will be storing integers.

> We will first implement the nodes.
>
> Each struct will have and integer called value and a pointer to a node called next.
